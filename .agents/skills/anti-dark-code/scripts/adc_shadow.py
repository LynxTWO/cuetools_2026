"""Shadow evidence records for SLICE-002.

One record says, for one change that CI verified in full, what the proposed
routing rules would have skipped and whether anything they skipped failed.
The record never asks the router how it did: the outcomes come from the run
that executed the canonical recipe regardless of any route, and this module
refuses to call a record measurable unless every canonical gate is present
with a real outcome. See `design/routing/SLICE-002-shadow-evidence.md`
sections 2 to 6, which are the contract this file implements, and D-125.
