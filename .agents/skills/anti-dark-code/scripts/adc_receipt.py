"""Routing receipts: the auditable record binding one route to one worktree.

A receipt exists to be disbelieved. Its job is not to record that a route was
taken, it is to make a stale route impossible to use by accident: if anything
the route depended on has moved, verification says so and names what moved.

Two rules shape everything here.

Authority is separate from observation. The authoritative payload holds only
what a route actually depends on, and `run_id` is its hash. Timestamps, host
names, and tool versions live outside that hash, because a receipt written
twice from the same inputs on two machines at two times is the same receipt,
and a clock must never be able to change routing authority. See R-023.

Freshness binds bytes, not status text. Git's porcelain status says a file is
modified; it does not say what it now contains. Two different edits to one file
produce identical status output, so a status digest would call a receipt fresh
across a change that alters what the route should have been. Freshness uses
object ids where git already has them and hashes current bytes, executable
modes, and symlink targets where it does not. See R-017.

This module writes and verifies. It does not decide what to run, and reading a
receipt never executes anything: a receipt is data, not an instruction.
