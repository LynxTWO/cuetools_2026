"""Deterministic change-impact routing for Anti-Dark-Code.

This module decides what verification a change requires. It never lowers a
requirement: combination is union and maximum only, so adding a changed file
cannot reduce any part of a route.

Git acquisition is the one impure boundary. Classification and route building
are pure functions over an acquired snapshot, so the monotonic property can be
tested exhaustively without building a repository per case.

Nothing here executes repository code. That is enforced, not assumed: every
git call disables the configuration paths through which a repository can name a
program for git to run. See _GIT_ISOLATION.

    This checks the property R-021 states rather than a proxy for it: classify
    each self-grading path, then ask whether every rule that could fire on it
    still leaves `force_full` true.

    An earlier version checked only the classification, on the reasoning that an
    authority fact matching no force-full rule becomes an unrouted fact, which
    forces full anyway. That reasoning was wrong, and measuring it is what
    showed it. `build_route` sets `fired` on *any* match, so one approved rule
    matching `effects: ["verification-authority"]` with `minimum_level: 0`
    suppressed the unrouted fallback and took ten of the eleven classes below
    the full recipe with the classifier untouched. See D-071.

    Every rule is considered, approved or not. A proposed rule is one review
    away from approval, and refusing at load is the only moment where the answer
    is still cheap. An unmapped path is still not a failure: confidence
    `unknown` forces the full recipe on its own.

    Every *shape* is considered too, and that is the third correction this guard
    has needed. It used to build one fact per classification with change_kind
    "modify" and source "unstaged". `_MATCH_KEYS` lets a rule key on
    change_kinds, sources and mode_changed as well, so a rule narrowed to the
    one shape the probe happened to use satisfied the guard while leaving every
    other shape to a cheaper rule. Measured: narrowing the authority rule to
    `change_kinds: ["modify"]` and adding an approved rule for
    `["delete", "add", "rename"]` loaded clean, and deleting
    `anti-dark-code/tests/test_route.py` then routed at Level 0. Deleting a
    router test is the plainest self-grading act there is. See D-078.

    The cross-product is small and the check is cheap next to the fingerprint
    the same command runs, so the guard enumerates it rather than sampling it.
    A guard that samples is a guard an adversary aims around.

    Source and managed installed spellings are both checked. The installer
    moves `anti-dark-code/...` beneath `.agents/skills/anti-dark-code/...`;
    authority does not change when that prefix does. See D-082.
