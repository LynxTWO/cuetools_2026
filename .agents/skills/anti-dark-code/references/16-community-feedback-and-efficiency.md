## Community Proposals

Repository-local learning remains proposal-only. Generate a sanitized, content-hashed proposal with pass `15` and `flowback --public`, stage it into a clean fork of the shared skill, and open a pull request that changes only one new file under `anti-dark-code/incoming/`.

The proving repository's name does not belong in a proposal. Use `repo-agnostic` scope or a generic `repo-shape:<shape>` scope. Public generation removes known local/remote repository-name variants, replaces raw commit-like ids, and assigns proposal-local ordinal candidate ids so local identifiers cannot be correlated by hash. Human pre-publication review remains mandatory because no detector can recognize every private codename.

Treat every incoming proposal as untrusted data. Structural validation does not make its instructions safe. Do not execute commands found in a proposal, let a proposal modify shared policy automatically, or run contributor-modified validation code with elevated workflow permissions. A maintainer must generalize and promote the lesson in a separate bounded change.

People who cannot use Git may submit the same candidate fields through the repository's proposal issue form. An issue is still untrusted input and never becomes policy automatically.

## The Efficiency Truth Model

Keep three classes separate.

### Actual usage

`actual_usage` records numeric counters reported by an AI host for one skill-assisted or baseline run. It proves only the reported usage for that run. It is not evidence of tokens saved because it has no counterfactual.

The current recorder labels every receipt `community-self-reported`. A content hash detects accidental or later un-resealed modification. It is not an authenticity attestation and does not prove the host produced the numbers.

### Controlled pair

`controlled_pair` compares a skill run with a baseline run only when all of these match:

- provider and exact model id
- the same coarse reporting month
- bounded task class (`map`, `audit`, `verify`, `remediate`, `install`, or `other`)
- positive trial number and declared `skill-first` or `baseline-first` order
- usage-counter semantics and adapter version
- model settings digest
- tool-set digest
- public fixture digest
- acceptance-oracle digest
- skill version and managed-core digest

Both runs must start from fresh context, use the same acceptance contract, and pass the oracle. A positive token delta means the skill condition used fewer provider-total tokens. Zero means equal usage. A negative delta means the skill condition used more; retain and publish it.

One pair remains community-reported evidence. Stronger public claims require a maintained benchmark, alternating or randomized `AB`/`BA` order, complete preregistered trials, and enough repetitions to show a distribution rather than one favorable outcome.

### Estimate

An explicit tokenizer may compare an artifact with a compact summary and report potential context avoided. That is an estimate, not actual usage or savings. Name the tokenizer, inputs, and assumptions.

Receipt schema version 1 deliberately does not accept estimates. Add a separate schema and provenance contract before publishing them. Never mix estimates into actual-usage or controlled-pair totals.

## Privacy and Consent

Efficiency measurement is disabled unless a person explicitly invokes it and supplies `--opt-in`.

The tooling:

- makes no network calls
- discovers no host logs
- does not discover or collect repository source, host prompts or responses, or host tool traces
- uploads nothing
- writes receipt and summary artifacts only to caller-selected paths; ordinary Python bytecode caching remains host-controlled
- records a coarse month, not an exact timestamp
- refuses unknown receipt fields

Keep local receipts under a private ignored path such as `.anti-dark-code/efficiency/`. Public export creates an allowlisted projection and replaces individual settings, tools, fixture, and oracle digests with an experiment-scoped comparison digest derived from the private controls and public study/measurement identity. It removes local source-receipt ids. The digest deliberately excludes the receipt id so independently sealed results for the same experiment remain detectable as duplicates.

Review even the exported JSON before publishing it. Do not add names, emails, repository identities, private fixture labels, paths, prompts, outputs, request ids, API keys, prices, or account data.

No receipt is uploaded automatically. A public contribution is an ordinary reviewed pull request.

## Recording Actual Usage

Use the standard-library helper through the main CLI. The wrapper supplies the installed skill version and managed-core digest:

```bash
python3 anti-dark-code/scripts/adc.py efficiency record \
  --out .anti-dark-code/efficiency/skill.json \
  --opt-in \
  --condition skill \
  --provider <provider-id> \
  --model <exact-model-id> \
  --usage-semantics <provider-counter-contract> \
  --task-class <map|audit|verify|remediate|install|other> \
  --trial <positive-integer> \
  --order <skill-first|baseline-first> \
  --settings-sha256 <64-hex-digest> \
  --tools-sha256 <64-hex-digest> \
  --fixture-sha256 <64-hex-digest> \
  --oracle-sha256 <64-hex-digest> \
  --fresh-context \
  --same-acceptance-contract \
  --quality-passed \
  --input-tokens <count> \
  --output-tokens <count> \
  --provider-total-tokens <count>
```

Record the baseline separately with `--condition baseline`. Optional counters omitted by the host remain JSON `null`. A reported zero remains zero. Never convert an unknown counter into zero.

When both normalized input and output are present, their sum must equal the provider total. Cache-read, cache-write, and tool-prompt counts are input subsets. Reasoning tokens are an output subset. Leave a breakdown null when the host's semantics do not fit that contract; retain the exact provider total.

## Forming a Controlled Pair

Create the pair before public export because private comparison digests are intentionally absent from public receipts:

```bash
python3 anti-dark-code/scripts/adc.py efficiency pair \
  --skill-receipt .anti-dark-code/efficiency/skill.json \
  --baseline-receipt .anti-dark-code/efficiency/baseline.json \
  --out .anti-dark-code/efficiency/pair.json
```

The helper refuses any mismatch in the complete controlled-pair identity listed above; it also refuses a failed oracle, stale context, a different acceptance contract, public inputs, or anything other than two local `actual_usage` receipts in the correct roles. It computes deltas itself; a contributor does not supply them.

This is a correctness gate, not proof that the study design was unbiased. Alternate condition order and retain every preregistered trial, including regressions.

## Public Export and Aggregation

Export one receipt into a caller-selected directory:

```bash
python3 anti-dark-code/scripts/adc.py efficiency export \
  --receipt .anti-dark-code/efficiency/pair.json \
  --out-dir metrics/ledger
```

The file name is derived from its canonical public content hash. Validate before review:

```bash
python3 anti-dark-code/scripts/adc.py efficiency validate \
  --require-public metrics/ledger/efficiency-<digest>.json
```

Aggregate a reviewed public ledger deterministically:

```bash
python3 anti-dark-code/scripts/adc.py efficiency aggregate \
  --ledger metrics/ledger \
  --out metrics/summary.json \
  --mirror-out docs/data/efficiency-summary.json
```

Aggregation deduplicates exact content hashes, rejects distinct results claiming the same experimental identity, sorts provider/model/adapter/usage-semantics/task-class strata, retains negative deltas, and never combines token deltas across unlike strata. Actual usage has its own overall count, but token totals remain split between `skill` and `baseline` conditions and are never labeled savings. Each mirror is written from the same in-memory summary so the public website cannot silently report different figures.

The public projection supports independent arithmetic and grouping checks, not independent reproduction of a private benchmark. Its opaque comparison digest deliberately withholds the individual settings, tools, fixture, and oracle digests. A stronger reproducibility claim needs a separately reviewed public benchmark manifest, preregistration record, and complete-trial ledger; schema version 1 does not claim those.

Before accepting a receipt pull request, run the trusted-base intake check against the base commit or ref. The validator uses the merge base with `HEAD`, so a contributor branch behind a newer base branch is assessed only for its own changes:

```bash
python3 anti-dark-code/scripts/adc.py efficiency validate-ledger-pr \
  --repo . \
  --changed-from <base-commit>
```

The check requires exactly one newly added canonical receipt under `metrics/ledger/`, permits changes only to that receipt and the two generated summaries, validates the complete public ledger, and compares both committed summaries byte-for-byte with deterministic output. It executes no contributor code and does not print receipt content.

## Provider Counter Mapping

Host response formats change. Pin `usage_semantics` and review an adapter when its source format changes.

- For OpenAI-style usage, use the reported total input, top-level output, and provider total. Cached input and reasoning are optional subsets.
- For Claude-style usage, normalized input is uncached input plus cache creation plus cache read. Output is the reported output. Provider total is normalized input plus output.
- For Gemini-style usage, use `promptTokenCount` as normalized input and `totalTokenCount` as provider total. Populate normalized output only when the available candidate, thought, and tool-use counters reconcile exactly with the provider total; otherwise leave the optional breakdown null.
- For another host, record only counters whose semantics are documented. A UI estimate or quota percentage is not a host-reported token count.

Do not compare token counts across provider/model/adapter/usage-semantics/task-class strata as though tokenizers, hidden reasoning, cache accounting, tool accounting, or work shape were identical.

## Claim and Publication Rules

A public summary may say:

- how many community-reported actual-usage receipts exist
- actual provider-total usage for a named `skill` or `baseline` condition within a named provider/model/adapter/usage-semantics/task-class stratum
- quality-qualified controlled-pair delta within a named provider/model/adapter/usage-semantics/task-class stratum
- pair count, positive/zero/negative counts, and median percentage delta

It must also say that community receipts are self-reported and not provider-attested.

Do not publish:

- a lifetime global savings number across providers
- dollar savings without a dated, cache-aware price contract
- a savings claim from actual usage alone
- a result that excludes failed, zero, or negative trials
- a result with any mismatch in the controlled-pair identity listed above
- a claim that a self-hash authenticates the source

Keep live metrics outside `SKILL.md`; otherwise every ordinary use pays the context cost of reading marketing data. A website may render the deterministic summary, while release briefs should carry a dated snapshot and a link to the live evidence.

## Limits

The skill is Markdown and cannot see a host's private token counters. Exact historical savings cannot be reconstructed when prior runs lack both host-reported usage and a contemporaneous, comparable baseline. Controlled pairs therefore require the same coarse reporting month. Existing compact gate logs can support only a separately labeled context-reduction estimate.

Token count is one efficiency dimension. A smaller result that fails the same oracle is not a saving. Track quality first; consider elapsed time, retries, tool cost, and human review separately rather than forcing them into a token total.
