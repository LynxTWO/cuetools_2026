# Reference: Dogfeeding and Flow-Back

Use this pass when a repo-local Anti-Dark-Code skill has learned something that may improve the shared skill.

**Mode:** calibration and proposal files only. Shared-core changes require a separate human-reviewed promotion.

## Goal

Let known repositories become proving grounds without letting repo-specific assumptions, private details, or compromised instructions poison the shared skill.

The loop is:

1. A clean shared core installs into a repository.
2. Repo calibration binds to that repository identity and adapts to local truth.
3. Bounded work produces evidence.
4. Local facts update local calibration.
5. General lessons enter an upstream queue.
6. A deterministic tool stages a redacted proposal.
7. A human reviews, generalizes, tests, and promotes it into the shared core.
8. The updated core is reinstalled into participating repositories.

Calibration never flows sideways into another repository.

## Verify the Binding First

Before trusting or exporting local learning, verify that `calibration/repo-binding.json` matches the current repository.

Flow-back must stop when calibration is:

- unbound
- invalid
- bound to another repository identity

A copied calibration directory is not evidence that its lessons belong to the current repository.

## Read Calibration First

Before a pass, read only the calibration files relevant to the slice.

- invariants prevent accidental boundary violations
- system map prevents cold recrawls
- exact gates prevent command rediscovery
- coverage ledger prevents fresh surfaces from being re-audited
- findings ledger prevents settled work from being re-triaged
- verification plan prevents uniform, wasteful testing

A stale calibration entry is worse than no entry. Check freshness against changed paths and the current source identity.

A matching binding proves repository continuity, not factual freshness.

## Write Local Learning Back

After a pass, update the appropriate local record:

- new load-bearing truth -> `invariants.md`
- new or moved boundary -> `system-map.md`
- audited or invalidated surface -> `coverage-ledger.md`
- opened, fixed, refuted, or deferred issue -> `findings-ledger.md`
- new gate or machine constraint -> `gates.json`
- changed verification need -> `verification-plan.json`

Use evidence labels and cite the source path, command, test, or artifact.

These records remain local to the bound repository.

## Upstream Candidate Test

A lesson belongs in `upstream-candidates.md` only when all are true:

- it is useful beyond this repository
- it can be stated without repo names, private paths, project secrets, or local architecture assumptions
- it survived at least one concrete failure, refutation, or measurable comparison
- the evidence and limits are named
- the proposal says which shared reference, template, capability, or script should change
- the proposed wording does not silently assume one language, framework, repo type, operating system, or agent host

A repo fact is not a general lesson.

A preference is not evidence.

One surprising incident may justify observation. It does not automatically justify a universal rule.

## Candidate Shape

Use this form:

```markdown
## ADC-LOCAL-001: <short title>

- Status: ready
- Scope: repo-agnostic
- Lesson: <general rule>
- Evidence: <local paths, tests, commands, or findings>
- Limits: <where the rule may not apply>
- Proposed target: <shared file or capability>
- Proposed change: <smallest useful change>
```

Valid statuses are `observing`, `ready`, `staged`, `promoted`, and `rejected`.

## Stage a Proposal

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/anti-dark-code/scripts/adc.py flowback --repo .
```

The command:

- verifies the repository binding
- reads only `ready` entries
- replaces the repository root and home path with placeholders
- redacts common secret-like assignments
- creates a content-hashed proposal under `.anti-dark-code/flowback/`
- does not copy calibration
- does not edit the shared skill

Pattern redaction reduces exposure. It is not proof that every sensitive value was removed. Review the proposal before sharing or staging it.

## Stage to a Shared Inbox

A maintainer may stage the proposal into a clean shared skill's inbox with an explicit path and flag:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/anti-dark-code/scripts/adc.py flowback \
  --repo . \
  --parent /path/to/shared/anti-dark-code \
  --stage-to-parent
```

The parent must:

- contain a valid universal `SOURCE-SCOPE.json`
- contain clean, unbound calibration templates
- contain no top-level repo-owned calibration
- not be a repo-local source disguised as the shared core

Staging writes one incoming proposal. It does not modify core references or scripts.

The installer excludes the shared `incoming/` review inbox from repo-local managed copies. A proposal from one repository must not be distributed into other repositories merely because it is awaiting review. The flow-back writer also refuses symbolic-link or junction-backed parent inbox paths or destination files so a staged proposal cannot be redirected outside the reviewed shared core.

A live shared core with pending proposals should use `adc.py validate --mode universal`. A release candidate must use `adc.py validate --mode distribution`, which rejects the runtime-only inbox.

## Promotion Gate

Before promotion into the shared skill:

1. Remove repo-specific nouns, paths, identifiers, commands, and assumptions.
2. Check whether the rule already exists.
3. Identify repo types where it applies and where it does not.
4. Separate observation from causation.
5. Add or update deterministic tests for any script change.
6. Check that examples use placeholders rather than real user paths.
7. Validate cross-host packaging.
8. Run `adc.py validate --mode universal` against the live shared core, then `adc.py validate --mode distribution` against the clean release candidate, plus the skill's unit tests with ordinary `python3`.
9. Record the source candidate and the human decision.
10. Promote in one bounded shared-core change.

A local repository never grants itself permission to rewrite global instructions.

## General Lessons from Repo-Local Dogfeeding

Several broad patterns are useful across repo types:

- pre-seeded calibration makes a known repository cheaper and safer than cold re-derivation
- verifier count should follow finding class and reproducibility
- exact gates with real exit codes beat subjective review
- duplicated rules across engine, view, adapter, migration, or compatibility boundaries are drift risks
- targeted green is not system green in emergent or aggregate behavior, so keep an aggregate canary
- deterministic output-count probes plus temporary configuration isolation can narrow emergent regressions faster than broad code reading
- aggregation semantics in manifests or registries can let one declaration reclassify an entire system
- chunking or batching can be tested metamorphically when total work should remain equivalent
- dependency graphs can settle layering and cycle claims more cheaply than model debate
- UI exploration, fuzzing, and replay become much stronger when instrumentation is observational and failures are seed-replayable
- repository identity and factual freshness are separate questions
- local learning should move upward as a reviewed rule, never sideways as copied calibration

These are generalized rules. Repository-specific invariants, paths, gates, and findings remain local.

## Rejection Reasons

Reject or return a candidate when it:

- names a private repository or developer path
- depends on one project's internal architecture
- proposes copying local calibration into the shared core
- asks the shared installer to execute a repo command automatically
- treats a one-off bug as a universal law
- lacks evidence or limits
- duplicates an existing rule without adding tested value
- weakens source, binding, execution, or approval safeguards

## Acceptance Checklist

Flow-back is complete when:

- local calibration reflects the pass
- the local binding matches the current repository
- each upstream candidate is genuinely repo-agnostic
- private and repo-specific details stay local
- ready candidates are staged as proposals only
- no calibration directory was copied
- the shared core was not silently edited
- the parent source was verified as universal and clean
- promotion has a human decision and deterministic validation
